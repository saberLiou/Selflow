# Selflow(Roughly Completed.)
A blog like CMS web application with an admin panel for administrator to control, made of Laravel 5.4, developed in Homestead.

After migrating all tables, you must use php artisan db:seed to insert default three roles "administrator, author and subscriber" and the category "Uncategorized" to set all the things done in this system.

If a user of any role is "inactive", he or she may not create, update and delete a post, even leave a comment or make a reply on post. Active users can only write a comment and reply now, without editing or destroying.

Because of the developing stage, I just hosted it in a free heroku.
Here's the website link for demo: https://selflow.herokuapp.com/
